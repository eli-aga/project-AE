## Discussion

Some concluding remarks:

1. Even with the help of chatGPT we could not find a link between the region identifier and the zoology museum.
2. LLMS were fundamental, specifically chatGPT and gemini, for the project's execution, since we are not professionals in the field.
3. It was stimulating to find new solutions and enrichments for a project that involves both the cultural sphere, the university we come from, and directly the active role of us students.
